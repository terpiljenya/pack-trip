# TripSync AI - Replit Documentation

## Overview

TripSync AI is a group travel planning application that facilitates collaborative trip planning through a chat-first interface. The application helps small groups coordinate travel dates, budgets, destinations, and booking details through real-time conversations and voting mechanisms.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket integration for live collaboration

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Python 3.11 with FastAPI framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **Real-time**: WebSocket support via FastAPI WebSockets
- **Session Management**: To be implemented

## Key Components

### Database Schema
The application uses a PostgreSQL database with the following main entities:
- **users**: User authentication and profile data
- **trips**: Trip metadata and state management
- **tripParticipants**: User-trip relationships with roles and online status
- **messages**: Chat messages with support for different message types (user, agent, system)
- **votes**: User voting on trip options with emoji reactions
- **tripOptions**: Available trip choices (flights, hotels, activities)
- **dateAvailability**: User availability for specific dates

### Real-time Features
- **WebSocket Communication**: Live chat updates and participant status
- **Collaborative Voting**: Real-time emoji voting on trip options
- **Date Availability Matrix**: Interactive calendar for group scheduling
- **Online Presence**: Real-time participant online/offline status

### UI Components
- **Chat Interface**: Primary conversation thread for trip planning
- **Context Drawer**: Collapsible sidebar with calendar, itinerary, and budget views
- **Interactive Calendar**: Group availability matrix with conflict detection
- **Voting System**: Quick emoji reactions for trip options
- **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive layout optimized for mobile devices

## Data Flow

1. **Trip Initialization**: Users create or join trips through unique trip IDs
2. **Real-time Collaboration**: WebSocket connections enable live updates across all participants
3. **Progressive Planning**: Two-stage process from high-level planning to detailed booking
4. **State Management**: Trip state machine progresses through defined stages (INIT ‚Üí COLLECTING_DATES ‚Üí VOTING ‚Üí BOOKED)
5. **Consensus Building**: Voting mechanisms help groups reach decisions on dates, destinations, and options

## External Dependencies

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment

## Next Steps Plan

### 1. Complete End-to-End Experience (Detailed Trip Planning)
- **Trigger**: When voting reaches consensus (100% votes on one option)
- **Implementation**:
  - Add OpenAI integration to backend
  - Create endpoint `/api/trips/{trip_id}/generate-detailed-plan`
  - Generate detailed itinerary with specific places, times, and activities
  - Store as new message type "detailed_plan" with structured data
  - Display in chat as expandable cards with daily breakdown

### 2. Create New Trips
- **Implementation**:
  - Add landing page with "Create New Trip" button
  - Generate unique trip IDs (e.g., "NYC-2025-001")
  - Create trip initialization flow (destination, dates, title)
  - Auto-join creator as first participant

### 3. Invite Links & Authorization
- **Implementation**:
  - Generate shareable links: `/join/{trip_id}?token={invite_token}`
  - Create simple auth system (no passwords, just display names)
  - Store user session after joining
  - Add participant limit and expiration to invites

### 4. Map Integration
- **Implementation**:
  - Use Leaflet for open-source maps (no API key needed)
  - Parse locations from detailed plan
  - Show numbered markers for each day's activities
  - Add map view tab in context drawer
